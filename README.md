## Description

This is a simple restaurant tip calculator app that I wrote for iOS and Watch OS.  It aims to be a simple, quick, and easy-to-use tip calculator without a lot of frills and gimmicks.  I wanted to focus on the watch portion of the app, because it seems that the wrist is the most convenient place for a user to actually use an app like this.

## Purpose

This started out as an assignment in one of the free online Swift courses I was working on while I was just starting to learn Swift programming.  After finishing it, I figured I may as well submit it to the App Store.  It was an exciting experience to see it get approved, and then to see it getting some downloads.  Later on, when the Apple Watch was released, I wrote an extension so you could use it on the Apple Watch.

## Feature Wish List

This app was written while I was an even bigger newbie than I am now.  The entire code should probably be mostly re-written.  In addition there are several features I would like to eventually add to this app:

- 3D Touch support for iOS version
- Support for custom tip amount
- Round option so you can round a tip to the nearest dollar amount.
- Region support so that correct currency symbol shows up
- Photograph / Social sharing option
- Receipt storage
